<h1>hair gel</h1>
<p>Hair Gel History :
    <p> Modern hair gel traces its routes back to household cleaners. In 1929, an English company called Chemico Works - manufacturers of kitchen cleaners - decided to diversify. They created the first hair gel designed for consumers and marketed it as Brylcream.</p>
        <p>What did they use before hair gel?</p>
    
            <p>    Around the year 1300, lizard tallow (which is rendered from the fat of animals) was blended with swallow droppings to create hair gel. Women also conditioned their hair by boiling dead lizards in olive oil.</p>
